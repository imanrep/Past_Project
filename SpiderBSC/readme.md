Using Remix as EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) to deploy the Smart Contract to Testnet, and validation for web3 things. Why im using testnet on Remix ? Why im not using framework like Ganache, Hardhat ?

- Remix on testnet is better to check the development, fast, and easy.
- I do use Ganache / Hardhat, but its better to development for your own chain or your own data.
